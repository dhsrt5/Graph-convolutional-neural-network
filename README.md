# Graph-convolutional-neural-network

This set of code includes the modeling, analysis, and dataset generation of Voronoi polycrystals. The construction and training of two models: graph convolutional neural networks and multilayer convolutional neural network
1.Generate voronoi geometric models as needed through the demo.m file;

2.Run the voronoi_Euler_run.py by Abaqus;

3.Run the voronoi_pic.py;

4.Establish a network model through the GCN.py or MULT-CNN.py;

5.Data post-processing through other software.
